.SH "Description"
\fBsycersion\fR is a command\-line tool to manage application versions following the guiding principles of \fIsemantic versioning\fR found at semver\.org \fIhttps://semver\.org\fR\.
.
.P
\fBsycersion\fR has a default start version of 0\.1\.0\. This can be activitated with the initalization running \fBsycersion \-\-init\fR\. During this intialization another version can be chosen\. The version is saved to the \fIversion\-file\fR and also the \fIconfiguration\-directory\fR is created\. While initialization \fBsycersion\fR additionally searches for files that contain a version according to semantic versioning and the user can select out of the list of files which version out of that files to intially start with\.
.
.P
The \fIversion\-file\fR and \fIconfiguration\-directory\fR are also created it the user is setting an initial version with \fBsycersion \-\-set 0\.1\.1\fR\.
.
.P
If the version is updated the version is written into the \fIversion\-file\fR\. Within the application the version can be read from the file and displayed somewhere in the application\'s UI\.
.
.P
\fBsycersion\fR evaluates version numbers provided that they comply to semantic versioning\.
.
.P
If \fBsycersion\fR is used within a \fIRuby\fR application, it can be added to the development section within the Gemfile\.
.
.SH "FILES"

`\.sycersion` is the configuration directory
`\.sycersion/environment\.yml` holds the version file and the version
